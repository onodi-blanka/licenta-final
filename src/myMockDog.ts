        "An overweight, harlequin-patterned Dachshund with an unusual feature of six legs, rather than the typical four. The dog should be viewed from a three-quarter angle, allowing for all the legs to be visible. The harlequin pattern should include patches of black and tan colors, typical to the breed. This breed is known for its elongated body and short legs, which should be considered even in this unique six-legged depiction. A friendly yet puzzled expression on the dog's face adds a liveliness to the image.",
